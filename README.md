- 👋 Hi, I’m Caroline Margiotta. 
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging real-world data to understand the QOL and financial impacts of illness, as well as to learn about effective ways to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do in R what I used to do in SAS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of R and SAS packages to more efficiently conduct HEOR studies.
- 📫 You can reach me at carolineelysemargiotta@gmail.com.
